# JavaScript Koans

Inspired from the original [Ruby Koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) from Edgecase.

The JavaScript Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn JavaScript. The goal is to learn the JavaScript language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries. We also teach you culture by basing the koans on tests. Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live. Testing is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in JavaScript.
